# Watercolour Converter Website
## How to run the website locally
1. If you do not have it already, download [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
2. Use your favourite terminal to navigate into this projectâ€™s backend and make sure that the following folders and files exist (other folders may exist but they are not as important)
    - uploads
    - results
    - images
    - templates
    - app.py
    - model.pkl
3. Run the following commands in order
    - py -3 -m venv venv
    - pip install Flask
    - pip install flask-dropzone
    - python app.py
4. Once you run the last command a link will likely show up (it does at least in VS code and cmd). Follow it and the website should show up
